MAIN CONTENT
    about me - a few sections
        who am i?
        what do i like?
        what motivates me?
        what do i want to do (deep man)


each section a different project I've really liked
1 for accessibility - should be the entire website
1 for reusability - isnt this entire thing that?
1 for translations

Background color or image? what should it be?
redo color palatte for entire website - theres some need for cohesion & professionalism
    this needs to have people be impressed, not just a long form resume
